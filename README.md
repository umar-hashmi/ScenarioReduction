# ScenarioReduction
This repository contains the code for the proposed scenario reduction methodology. The methodology is demonstrated using case studies, which are included in the casestudies folder. To reproduce the results from the paper, several supporting function files must be loaded.

Repository Structure:
- Scenario reduction functions: These represent the core framework of the proposed methodology.

- Case studies: Scripts to reproduce the results shown in the paper.

- Supporting functions: Includes scenario generation, the PMDDistribution function, and other utilities needed to run the case studies.

Data:

- Distribution network (DN): A Spanish distribution network (POLA), provided in JSON format.

- Load profiles: Type 1 consumer profiles from Fluvius. These can be found at: https://github.com/umar-hashmi/Public-Load-profile-Datasets/blob/67649f157b0b1bc96a64f57504a0847c38bd3f85/Fluvius_Consumer_profiles_2022/Type1_consumer_Fluvius.zip
